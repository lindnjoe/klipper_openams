# AFC Hardware Configuration Example for OpenAMS
# This file should be copied to ~/printer_data/config/AFC/AFC_Hardware.cfg
# on your printer system during OpenAMS setup

# AFC Extruder Configuration
# This section is REQUIRED for OpenAMS to work properly
[AFC_extruder extruder]
# For OpenAMS with FPS (Filament Pressure Sensor) ramming:
# Use AMS_extruder as a virtual pin - this tells AFC that the FPS
# handles filament sensing and the OpenAMS code will manage it
pin_tool_start: AMS_extruder

# Alternative: If you're using a physical toolhead sensor instead:
# Uncomment the line below and comment out the AMS_extruder line above
# pin_tool_start: ^PC0  # Replace with your actual sensor pin

# Optional: Additional extruder-specific settings
# tool_stn: 10              # Distance from tool sensor to nozzle (mm)
# tool_stn_unload: 0        # Unload distance adjustment (mm)
# tool_load_speed: 10       # Loading speed (mm/s)
# tool_unload_speed: 10     # Unloading speed (mm/s)

# For multi-extruder setups, add additional AFC_extruder sections:
# [AFC_extruder extruder1]
# pin_tool_start: AMS_extruder  # or your sensor pin for second extruder
