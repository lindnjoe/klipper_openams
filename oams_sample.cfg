# This value instructs if the FPS slide HES value should be reversed
# and is critical to the operation of the OpenAMS

# you can check the value of the FPS by checking klippy.log
# from the command line

# When the OAMS has fed this ptfe_length - 100mm, it will slow down the speed of the feeder and 
# check if the slide is above the fps_upper_threshold.
# If this is the case, the loading will stop, assuming the 
# the filament bottomed out at the top of the gears of the toolhead extruder.
# If you have too much friction on the PTFE tubing, sharp bends, kinks, etc, you might
# have to solve these issues to lower the friction.
# A stiffer spring is provided with the OpenAMS kit to compensate for
# longer ptfe tube lengths.
